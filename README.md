# TerrainRenderDemo
A simple OpenGL ES 2.0 app for Android that randomly generates terrain and renders it. This is my second android app, and was intended to be a learning experience to become familiar with OpenGL ES and Android.

The app displays randomly generated terrain generated with a Perlin noise algorithim I implemented in Java, and applies a simple repeating texture to the terrain.
